# The ol' rust bucket

I needed a repo for pushing the work I do while learning Rust.
I'm fairly confident most of the work will probably be somewhat shoddy
due to sheer lack of knowledge and experience. This is why I named the
repo what I did. Hopefully by the end of this experiment in learning I'll
be able enough to come back and polish out some of the rusty bits, we'll see!
